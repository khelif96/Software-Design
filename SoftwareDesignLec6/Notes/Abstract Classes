Abstract Classes
    - Abstract classes are used as a superclasses in a class heirachy
    - Abstract Class may not have abstract methods but if a method in a class is prefaced with "abstract then that class is abstract"
    - An abstract method has no body and will be overridden in every sub classes of the hierarchy, otherwise the subclass becomes an abstract class
    - If a class is defined as an abstract class then you can call the constructor only through


    <code>
        public abstract Shape{
            // instance variables
                x;
                y;
                Color;
            // Set and get functions
            // moveTo
            // draw
            abstract Draw();
            abstract area();
            abstract perimeter();
        }
        </code>
