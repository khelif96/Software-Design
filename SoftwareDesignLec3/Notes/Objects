This.reference
    Every object can a make a reference to itself with the keyword "this"
        - When an instance method is called for a particular object, the method implictely uses the keyword "this" to
            refer to the objects instance variable the other methods

    <code>
        public class Time{
            // Instance variables
                private int hours;
                private int minutes;
                private int seconds;
            // Constructors
            // ![
                public Time(){
                    this(0,0,0);
                }
                public Time(int hours){
                    this(hours,0,0);
                }
                public Time(int hours, int minutes){
                    this(hours,minutes,0);
                }

          //  ]! // these constructors over load the constructor public Time(int hours, int minutes, int seconds);

                public Time(int hours,int minutes,int seconds){
                    this.hours = hours;
                    this.minutes = minutes;
                    this.seconds = seconds;
                }
