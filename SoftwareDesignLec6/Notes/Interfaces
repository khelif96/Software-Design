Interface

    - A class can implement multiple interfaces

    <code>
        public interface Shape{
            public getArea();
            public getPerimiter;
        }
        public interface Position{

        }
        public interface PositionalShape extends Shape, Position{

        }

        public Class extends Position{
            Position position = new Position();
        }

     </code>

     - You can use interface names as a data type the new object you assign the interface name to it is an object of the lcass implementing the interface


     HW Problem

     What is the problem with an abstract class implementing an interface?
