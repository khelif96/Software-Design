Composition
    - When the objects of one class have references to the objects of the other classes

Inheritance
    - Every Subclass object is an object of the super Class
        - [Subclass objects] are created by inheriting the attributes of a methods of an existing usper class
    - Unlike C++ java does not support multiple inheritance in which class is derived from more than one calss
        - Uses interfaces

Access Modifiers
    - public members are accessible whenever the program has a reference to an object of that class in any of its subclasses
        public members are fully inherited in all subclass in the class hierarchy
    - private members of a super class are accessible from within the class itself
    - protected members of a class outside the class hierarchy or package are private
        * Advantages of using protected members is so that other instances of a class can modify other instances but outside
            classes of different types can not affect the member
        * It essentially makes is so that methods are public to other objects of the same class but private to outside classes
